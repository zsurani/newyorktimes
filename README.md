# Project 2 - *New York Times*

**New York Times** is an android app that allows a user to search for articles on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [New York Times Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2).

Time spent: **25+** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **search for news article** by specifying a query and launching a search. Search displays a grid of image results from the New York Times Search API.
* [x] User can **scroll down to see more articles**. The maximum number of articles is limited by the API search.
* [x] User can tap on any image in results to see the full text of article **full-screen**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Used the **ActionBar SearchView** or custom layout as the query box
* [x] User can **share an article link** to their friends or email it to themselves
* [x] Improved the user interface and experiment with image assets and/or styling and coloring
* [ ] User can click on "settings" which allows selection of **advanced search options** to filter results
  * [x] User can configure advanced search filters such as:
    * [x] Begin Date (using a date picker)
    * [x] News desk values (Arts, Fashion & Style, Sports)
    * [x] Sort order (oldest or newest)
  * [ ] Subsequent searches have any selected filters applied to the results
  * [ ] Uses a lightweight modal dialog for filters rather than an activity
* [x] Replaces the default ActionBar with a [Toolbar](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-App-ToolBar).
* [x] Apply the popular [Butterknife annotation library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-Butterknife) to reduce view boilerplate.
* [x] Replace `GridView` with the [RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) and the `StaggeredGridLayoutManager` to improve the grid of image results displayed.
* [x] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable leveraging the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Parceler).
* [x] Replace Picasso with [Glide](http://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/get-to-know-glide-recommended-by-google/en) for more efficient image rendering.
* [ ] Before an article search is triggered by the user, displays the current top stories of the day by default.
* [x] Hides the `Toolbar` at the top as the user scrolls down through the results using the [CoordinatorLayout and AppBarLayout](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-App-ToolBar#reacting-to-scroll).
* [ ] Leverage the popular [GSON library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Android-Async-Http-Client#decoding-with-gson-library) to streamline the parsing of JSON data and avoid manual parsing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
